Prefixes are assigned for all the catalogues and documents that have an automatically assigned code and number. The objects prefixing is carried out both in the context of organizations and in the context of databases. "IB" prefix assigned to all the objects, and prefixof the organization - only to the Infobase objects associated with a particular organization.</p>
<p>Ordinaryly, the number or the code of the object formed according to the following scheme: <br>"OR" + "IB" + "-" + number/code, <br>гдe:</p>
<ul><li>"OR" — 3-character prefix of the organization; if the organization prefix is not specified, then "00." 
</li><li>"IB" — 3-character prefix of the infobase; if the infobase prefix is not specified, then "00." 
</li><li>"-" — hyphen that separates the prefix and the number (code).</li></ul><p><br>Specification of the number (code) with the IB  and organization prefix  occurs at the moment of an object entry only if the code or the number were not specified manually or have been deleted before its entry. At the moment of printed forms generation the document numbers are displayed without organization prefix, because the organization is usually displayed in a separate field of the printed form. At the same time the IB prefix in the number remains. Also in the numbers in the printed forms IS not displayed the nonsignificant leading zeros.</p></body></html>
