<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 18px"></p>
<p>Subsystem is capable of exchanging of electronic documents (ED) with counterparties: exchanging of the product catalogs, price lists , orders, TORG-12, acts , invoices for payment etc., and also perform a direct exchange of payment orders and extracts with the bank.<br>For electronic documents there is the possibility of an optional (not obligatory) use of electronic digital print full name (EDS) , which gives the exchange between the parties a legal significance and eliminates the use of papers. An exception is the exchange with the banks - the use of digital print full name there is obligatory .</p>
<p>In a direct exchange between the parties through the open communication channels there is an additional option to encrypt the data which is being transmitted.</p>
<p>The application automates the exchange of electronic documents for a single transactions through exporting and importing the data through the electronic document without presets as well as the work with electronic documents for repeated transactions, where the task of the initial setup is obligatory.</p>

<h3 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 30px">How to start using the opportunities of electronic documents exchange in the application?</h3></a>
<p>The application provides an easy opportunity to import and export the data through an electronic document without any prior setup , namely , data import through the document of information database on a computer disk or sending such a document via email to the counterparty in the form of an electronic document which is intended only for the automation of data input on the receiving side .<br>On the receiver side there is the possibility by an easy file selection to export the data to an existing document or to Creating a database on their basis.<br>This option of exchange allows you to automate the one-time transactions.</p>
<p>In order to start using the functional exchange of electronic documents for repeated transactions you must enable this feature separately in the general application settings and make preset of agreements on the use of electronic documents. </p>
<p>The application supports the following options for the exchange of electronic documents:</p>
<li>Easy import / export of the data through the file ; 
</li><li>Exchange through the electronic document management opertor (EDM operator); 
</li><li>Direct exchange between the counterparties ; 
</li><li>Exchange between organizations within the same company ; 
</li><li>Direct exchange with the banks. 
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 30px">Certain settings in the application provide the opportunities for the use of: </p>
<ul style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px"><li>electronic documents exchange when transferring the goods between organizations within a company; 
</li><li>direct interaction with the banks; 
</li><li>delayed sendings of electronic documents;

<h3 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 30px">Which cryptography settings for the electronic documents it is necessary to make?</h3>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 30px">If it is assumed that the exchange of electronic documents is to be used with electronic print full name and / or encryption, in the form of "Cryptography settings for electronic documents" must be specified the general application settings for cryptography and configured print full name certificates.</p>
