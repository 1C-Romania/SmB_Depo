<h1>Cash assets report</h1>
<p>The report shows flows of cash in banks and on hand. Open this report with the relevant link in the action panel.<br> <br>You can generate the report in the <strong>Statement</strong>, <strong>Balance </strong>or <strong>Dynamics</strong> mode. In the <strong>Statement </strong>mode, the report can show the flows of all the cash according to <a href="Catalog.PettyCashes/Help">petty cashes</a> and <a href="Catalog.BankAccounts/Help">bank accounts</a> for the selected period. IN the <strong>Balance </strong>mode, the report ignores receipts and expenses information and shows only the cash balances of the organization's accounts and cash desks as of the stated date.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Statement </strong>and <strong>Balance </strong>mode, the report can be generated in the flow currency or in the management accounting currency.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Dynamics </strong>mode, you can generate the report in two variants - Receipts dynamics and Expenses dynamics - showing the relevant cash dynamics as a bar graph or a diagram against the defined periodicity. Use them to analyze the dynamics and contribution of each budget item to the overall cash receipts and expenses in different periods.</p>
<p><br>The report periodicity is defined in the settings. By default, it is automatically defined according to the selected report period. For example, when you generate a monthly report, the periodicity is <strong>Day</strong>; for an annual report, it is <strong>Month</strong>. The analysis method is defined in the report settings and determines the diagram appearance. For the <strong>Dynamics </strong>analysis method, the line diagram highlights the dynamics of changing values. For the <strong>Dynamics and changes structure</strong> analysis method, the bar graph shows the changes dynamics so you can analyze their structure (e.g. you can find the budget item with the highest expenses this month). By default, the report is of the <strong>Dynamics and changes structure </strong>type.<br><br>The data of the dynamics report variants is shown in the management accounting currency.</p>
