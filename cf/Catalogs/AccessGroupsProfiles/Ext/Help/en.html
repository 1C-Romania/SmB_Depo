<p>Generally, <a href="Catalog.AccessGroupsProfiles.Form.ListForm/Help"><font color="#000080">access group profiles</font></a> are configured during implementation and configuration of the applied solution. They are designed to create complete sets of allowed actions (roles) with specified access rights and access rights limitations (access kinds) to be used in <a href="Catalog.AccessGroups/Help"><font color="#000080">access groups</font></a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, predefined access group profiles are not enough for necessary user access rights settings.  In such cases, the administrator can add or edit access group profiles.</p>
<p>Use profiles to:</p>
<ul><li>Create a common list of roles for a certain user group. For example, managers may have an <a href="Catalog.AccessGroupsProfiles.Form.ItemForm/Help"><font color="#000080">access group profile</font></a> called <strong>Manager </strong>including the following roles: 
<ul><li><strong>Adding and editing customer orders</strong> 
</li><li><strong>Reading reference data</strong> 
</li><li>...</li></ul></li><li>Define the access kinds you use to access certain list items, documents, etc. available for the roles from the above list. For example, the <strong>Manager </strong>profile may allow (or forbid) access to specific customer orders, reference materials and other application data in terms of organizations, partners, operation types, and other available access kinds. Specific values for organizations, partners, operation types, and other access kinds defined in the profile are configured in the relevant <a href="Catalog.AccessGroups/Help"><font color="#000080">access groups</font></a>.</li></ul><h3>Access kinds and limitations</h3>
<ul><li>According to their character, roles may or may not support access limitation within certain access kinds. For example, the <strong>Adding and editing customer orders </strong>role may limit adding and editing customer orders in terms of organizations and partners, while the <strong>Starting web client </strong>role allows starting a web client regardless of anything. 
</li><li>Therefore, when you set up access kind content in the profile, remember that a profile must have a comprehensive list of access kinds for all the roles in it.  
</li><li>If a certain access kind has not been specified in the profile, limitations will not apply to it (as if it was not used in the role access limitation logic).</li></ul><h3>Application administration profile</h3>
<ul><li>The application contains the predefined <strong>Administrator </strong>profile having only one role, <strong>Full rights</strong>. This role provides full access to application data with no limitations. It is not recommended to add the <strong>Full rights </strong>role to any other profiles, since it automatically disables any access limitations (a profile with this role "turns into" <strong>Administrator</strong>). 
</li><li>The <strong>Administrator </strong>profile is used in the predefined <a href="Catalog.AccessGroups.Form.ItemForm/Help"><font color="#000080">access group</font></a>: <strong>Administrators</strong>. It is not recommended to create other <a href="Catalog.AccessGroups.Form.ListForm/Help"><font color="#000080">access groups</font></a> with this profile.</li></ul></body></html>
