<h1>Discount card kinds catalog</h1>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px">The application provides for various discounts (extra charges) based on discount cards. </p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px">You can apply any cards - either impersonal or membership, in-house cards or cards from other manufacturers (for example, social cards). </p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px">If the <strong>Membership card</strong> checkbox is selected, the card is considered to be membership and when such cards are registered, owners of the cards have to be indicated (the <strong>Counterparties</strong> catalog item).</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px">To define the kind of a discount card, the following card types are used: Barcode, Magnetic or Mixed.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px">For barcode cards, reading is possible with the use of a barcode scanner. </p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px">For magnetic cards, reading is possible with the use of a magnetic stripe reader.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px">For mixed cards, both types of reading are possible.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px">A customer loyalty card may be used to provide either fixed or accumulated discounts. </p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px">If you select the <strong>Fixed discount</strong> option, then you can specify the percentage of the discount (with plus) or extra charge (with minus).</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px">If you select the <span class="a1ctranslator_highlight4"><strong>Progressive discount</strong></span> option, then you can specify thresholds for the progressive discount. </p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px">To define the percentage of a progressive discount, the application analyzes the sales amount. Sales amounts may be analyzed for various periods.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px">If in the <strong>Accumulate for</strong> field the <strong>All time </strong>value is selected, then all counterparty's sales will be taken into account.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px">If in the <strong>Accumulate for</strong> field the <strong>Current </strong>value is selected, then the sales for the current year, month or quarter will be taken into account (to be selected by the user).</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px">If in the <strong>Accumulate for</strong> field the <strong>Previous</strong> value is selected, all sales for the previous year, month or quarter will be taken into account (to be selected by the user). For example, the current month is April and the accumulations are to be taken for the previous month. IN this case the sales for the whole March will be taken into account. </p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px">If in the <strong>Accumulate for</strong> field the <strong>Last </strong>value is selected, then sales for the last year, month or quarter will be taken into account (to be selected by the user). For example, today is April 14-th and accumulations are to be accounted for the last month. IN this case sales for the period from March 14-th to April 14-th will be taken into account. </p>

<p>Example. A company applies a progressive discount system based on discount cards. <br></p>
<p></p>
<p>If sales amount for the whole period of working with the counterparty &gt;= 1000 and &lt; 5000 rubles, discount = 10% <br>if sales amount &gt;= 5000 and &lt; 20000 rubles, discount = 15% <br>if sales amount &gt;= 20000, discount = 20%; <br><br>In this case you need to select the <strong>All time</strong> value for the <strong>Accumulate for</strong> field, and then in the threshold table enter the 4 lines as follows: <br>in the 1-st line: lower threshold = 1000, discount = 10 <br>in the 2-nd line: lower threshold = 5000, discount = 15. <br>in the 3-rd line: lower threshold = 40000, discount = 20. <br></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px">All loyalty cards are grouped by kinds of cards. New kinds of cards with various discounts are to be registered by the marketing manager. When a new card is registered, its kind is defined automatically in accordance with the ranges of codes specified by the kind of the card. When using the progressive discount system, information of required card replacements is provided at the moment of sale. The sales person may provide the buyer with a new card or replace the card later.</p>
