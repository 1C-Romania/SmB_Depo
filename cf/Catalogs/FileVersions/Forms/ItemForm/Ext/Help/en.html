<p>You can use the form to view the information on file version.</p>
<p>Application suggests saving the file version and entering data about this version after completion of file edition (by running the <strong>Complete </strong>command in the <a href="Catalog.Files.Form.Files/Help">files list</a>). This option is enabled by default (it is recommended to use versions saving as in case of serious mistakes that may lead to file damage, there would be an option to return to earlier, non-damaged version). Subsequently there is an option to edit the comment and if necessary to change the version author.</p>
