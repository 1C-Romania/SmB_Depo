<p>Viewing or creating the production calendar.</p>
<p>Business calendar is a sort of classifier, constant data that does not change during the year.   </p>
<p>The Russian national production calendar is included in the delivered application data and updated according to amendments in the Russian national holidays. </p>
<p>If necessary, you can maintain multiple <a href="Catalog.BusinessCalendars/Help">production calendars</a>. Different regions may have different holidays and, therefore, different extra working days.</p>
<p>It is recommended to introduce production calendar according to the national production calendar for the entire year. That will prevent calculation errors during the year. Business calendar itself is not used for accounting. On its basis, you can create <a href="Catalog.Calendars/Help">work schedules</a> of your departments and work schedules for your employees.  </p>

<p>You can use this option if the calendar data is necessary, but it is not yet officially adopted and the application does not have it yet, i.e. some transfers may not be approved by the government. You may fill in the transfers in advance, and later, when the national calendar data is approved and added to the application, the transferred dates will be corrected automatically.</p>
