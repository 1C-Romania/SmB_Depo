<p>Designed for storing and processing contact information of the company.  </p>
<p>Different lists handle contact information similarly. All lists provide equal opportunities in working with addresses and phone numbers. You can also store contact information in document tables and export contact information. It may be necessary for electronic accounting documents, since they need to save an accurate copy of the data submitted to the tax authorities including individual addresses and phone numbers.</p>
<p>The application is delivered with predefined list groups and items. The predefined list groups correspond with the application lists or documents containing the contact information. You can not add new groups to the list. The group items determine the contact information content for the relevant application objects.</p>
<p>The list and document tables provide several predefined contact information kinds. Moreover, you can add new contact information kinds.</p>
<p>We recommend setting up the contact information kinds at the initial filling stage. You can also set it up while maintaining your contact information. IN most cases, it is done by the administrator. </p>
<p>To open the list, use the relevant command of the navigation panel in <strong>Administration - General settings</strong>.</p>
