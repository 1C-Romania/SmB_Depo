<p>The catalog is used to manage the <a href="Catalog.DigitalSignaturesAndEncryptionKeyCertificates.Form.ChoiceForm/Help">certificates</a> of the digital signature keys and data encryption.</p>
<p>Digital signature is an attribute of any electronic document by which you can make ensure the invariance of the electronic document since its signature. For signature you need to have the <a href="Catalog.DigitalSignaturesAndEncryptionKeyCertificates.Form.ItemForm/Help">certificate</a> of an digital signature key. There is an option to obtain the certificate of an digital signature key with the help of cryptographic services (providers) or operating system.</p>
<p>Invariance control of an electronic document is ensured by checking the compliance of the digital signature of the document and the certificate of digital signature key. If the digital signature complies to the certificate, it is a guarantee of that the document was not changed by someone since its signature. You can run invariance control of an electronic document at any moment.</p>
<p>With the help of digital signature you can:</p>
<ul><li>Sign application objects (for example, the <strong>Name</strong> and<strong> Short description</strong> fields); 
</li><li><a href="Catalog.DigitalSignaturesAndEncryptionKeyCertificates.Form.SigningData/Help">Sign</a> files; 
</li><li><a href="Catalog.DigitalSignaturesAndEncryptionKeyCertificates.Form.DataEncryption/Help">Encrypt</a> the content of the files; 
</li><li><a href="Catalog.DigitalSignaturesAndEncryptionKeyCertificates.Form.DataDetail/Help">Decrypt</a> encrypted files.</li></ul></body></html>
