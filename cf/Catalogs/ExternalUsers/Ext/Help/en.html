<p>It is used to support users working with the application externally. As a rule, their access is limited. External users do not take active part in accounting processes, work separately and do not interact with each other. For example, employees in the human resources base, customers of the online shop, respondent of the questionnaire base.</p>
<p>You can open the external user list from the <strong>Administration</strong> section - <strong>User and right settings</strong>. You can also open it from the <strong>Questionnaire (Access management)</strong> section.</p>
