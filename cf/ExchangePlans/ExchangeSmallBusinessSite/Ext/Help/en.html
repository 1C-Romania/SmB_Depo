<p>Exchange orders proceeds in two steps: first - exporting from site, then importing to the site (or to the directory on drive). By orders, loaded from site, documents <a href="Document.CustomerOrder/Help"><font color="#0000ff">"Customer order"</font></a> are genersted. On the next exchange sessions, tabular sections of documents updated according to the information, received from the site. The information about payment and shipping on orders, earlier loaded, is sent to the site in a reply message. Counterparties and items, received from a site, are identified in the relevant catalogs. Objects, which are not found, will be Creatingd.</p>
<p>In the field <strong>"Metod of counterparties loading"</strong> specified a method, how a counterparty, specified in the order on the site, will be matched with counterparties in the infobase. The next methods are available:</p>
<ul><li>Search by description; 
</li><li>Search by INN; 
</li><li>Do not Creating. When you load order into the document <a href="Document.CustomerOrder/Help"><font color="#0000ff">"Customer order"</font></a>  of infobase, earlier defined counterparty, specified in the field <strong>"Fill Orders With This Company"</strong>, will be placed. </li></ul><p><br>In the fields <strong>"Belongs to group for new items"</strong> and <strong>"Belongs to group for new counterparties"</strong> can be specified groups, in which will be loaded items, not found in the infobase. If the groups is not specified, items, which are not found in infobase, will be loaded to the total list.</p>
<p>The method to determine Status of the customer order, when importing to the site and exporting from the site into the infobase depends on the flag <strong>"Use few Status of customer orders (three and more)"</strong> (situated on tab <strong>"Sales"</strong> of the configuring accounting settings form):</p>

If the correspondence of statuses is Created, when loading order wrom site application performs search corresponding to it Status of the document <a href="Document.CustomerOrder/Help"><font color="#0000ff">"Customer order"</font></a> in the infobase. Moreover if the Status of the document <a href="Document.CustomerOrder/Help"><font color="#0000ff">"Customer order"</font></a>, corresponding to the status obtained from the site is not found, the Status of the order will be set to default. To transfer information about payment or shipping an order to a site, you need to change the Status of the document <a href="Document.CustomerOrder/Help"><font color="#0000ff">"Customer order"</font></a> and refill the document.
