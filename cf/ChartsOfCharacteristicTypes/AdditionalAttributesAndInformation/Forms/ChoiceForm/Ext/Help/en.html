<p>The list is used to select <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.AdditionalAttributesAndInformation/Help">additional attributes (data).</a> </p>
<p>You can open the list using the <strong>Additional attributes (data)</strong> list by running the <strong>Add - By template</strong> or <strong>Add - Common </strong>commands as follows. </p>
<h3>Adding according to template</h3>
<p>There is an option to use previously entered additional attributes and data from other <a href="Catalog.AdditionalAttributesAndInformationSets/Help">sets</a>, add attributes with common list of values for several single-type attributes (for example, <strong>Color of door </strong>by the <strong>Color</strong> attribute template). IN this case you can use the list of values from the attribute-template. It is convenient to configure centralized setting of the values list for several single-type attributes simultaneously.</p>
<ul><li>Select already existing <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.AdditionalAttributesAndInformation.Form.ItemForm/Help">additional attribute (data)</a>. 
</li><li>Click <strong>Select</strong><strong>. </strong>
</li><li>You can also double-click. 
</li><li>The type and all values of the additional attribute (data) selected as a template will be copied to a new item. </li></ul><h3>Adding common additional attributes (data)</h3>
<p>The common attribute is included in several sets. This option is suitable for the cases when not only the list of values shall be common, but the attribute as well. The common attributes are grouped and displayed as one attribute in one column or field in the items lists and reports of different catalogs and documents. For example, using common <strong>Color</strong> attribute there is an option to select all yellow clothes and shoes.</p>
<ul><li>Select already existing additional attribute (information). If no required atribute is in the list, click <strong>Create</strong>. Fill in all necessary fields. 
</li><li>Click <strong>Select. </strong>
