Field content shall be displayed when hovering over the field of additional attribute (data). </li></ul></li><li>Fill in the <strong>Note </strong>field to display attribute discription while selecting additional attribute (data) to the <a href="Catalog.AdditionalAttributesAndInformationSets/Help">sets</a> in the bottom part of the <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.AdditionalAttributesAndInformation.Form.ChoiceForm/Help">selection list</a>. To fill it in<strong> </strong>go to the<strong> Note </strong>tab<strong>.</strong> </li></ul><h3>Adding by sample</h3>
<ul><li>In the application there is an option to use previously entered additional attributes and information from other sets. It is possible to add the attributes with common list of values <strong>By sample</strong> for several single-type attributes simultaneously. Using this entry option it is convenient to configure centralized settings of the values list for several single-type attributes. The <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.AdditionalAttributesAndInformation.Form.ChoiceForm/Help">list</a> of all additional attributes (data) already existing in the application shall be opened. You can add a new additional attribute (data) to the object using this list and the <strong>Select </strong>command<strong>. </strong>
</li><li>The type and all values of the additional attribute (data) selected as a sample shall be copied to a new item. Fill in all necessary fields. 
</li><li>By default the attribute is common with the set where the sample was taken from. IN this case you can not enter new values. The application displays reminder that the list of values is common with other attribute. After additional attribute (data) is saved, you can view the attribute-sample using corresponding link and to add values if necessary. 
</li><li>The attribute created by sample and having common list of values with other attribute may be modified to individual attribute. 
<ul><li>To do this click <strong>Change</strong>, select<strong> Attribute with its list of values </strong>in the opened <strong>Change settings of additional attribute (data)</strong> window and save the changes. The list of values shall be copied replacing all links in documents. After this you can enter the list of values. 
</li><li><strong>Attention</strong>: such reconfiguration for already existing attributes (used for documents entry) shall be performed with caution. Reconfiguration of the attribute is irreversible, can be carried out automatically, but takes a lot of time and can be ended incorrectly. You can replace the values in already existing documents manually clearing previous values and adding new (recommended).</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Adding common additional attributes (data)</h3>
<ul><li>Common additional attribute (data) is included into several sets. This option is for the cases when not only the list of values shall be common but the attribute as well. The common attributes are grouped and displayed as one attribute in one column or field in the items lists and reports of various catalogs and documents. It is entered by the <strong>Add - Common</strong> command. To add common attribute to several sets, select each set and run the command. 
</li><li>In the <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.AdditionalAttributesAndInformation.Form.ChoiceForm/Help">list</a> offered you can select already existing common additional attribute (data) or <strong>Create</strong>. Entry is carried out according to general rules. Fill in all necessary fields. 
</li><li>Window header contains description<strong> (Common additional Attribute) </strong>or <strong>(Common Information). </strong>
</li><li>At the bottom of common additional attribute (data) window the <strong>Common Attribute (Common data) is included into the set</strong> link is displayed with<strong> </strong>the list of sets when it is located in one or several sets. 
</li><li>Using <strong>Change</strong> button (near the link) you can modify common attribute to individual attribute with its own list of values. 
<ul><li>Select<strong> </strong>the <strong>Attribute with its list of values </strong>in the opened <strong>Change settings of additional attribute (data)</strong> window, and then save the changes. The list of values shall be copied replacing all links in documents. 
</li><li><strong>Attention</strong>! Reconfiguration of additional attribute (data) is irreversible and takes a lot of time depending on the number of documents where this attribute is filled in. It is possible to add new attribute with its list of values instead and carry out gradual transition from that attribute application to a new one manually (clear values of this attribute and fill in the values of a new one).</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a name="#1">Types of additional attributes and data values</a></h3>
<p>Type of additional attribute and data values is changed based on the application. The following types of additional attribute or data are available:</p>
<ul><li><strong>String</strong> - Specify<strong> </strong>the <strong>Length</strong> of the string<strong>, </strong>select <strong>Fixed</strong> or <strong>Variable</strong> (if entered string is less than it is assumed, then number of characters assigned for this value, will be automatically reduced to actual one). IN this case maximum length of the string is 1044 characters. It is also possible<strong> </strong>to select<strong> </strong>an<strong> Unlimited</strong> checkbox if it is planned to enter large volume of text information. 
<ul><li>For the additional attribute of <strong>String </strong>type there is an option to make the field multiline in the application. To do this enable <strong>Multiline input field</strong> checkbox and enter number of lines. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Number - </strong>select<strong> </strong>the <strong>Length</strong> of the number and its <strong>Precision</strong>. By default the application offers the length of the number equals to 15 and precision equals to 4. Depending on the data entered these values can be changed. It is necessary to take into account that the number of characters included in the Number Length comprises the number of characters of the integral part, decimal point and number of characters of fractional part. If needed, enable <strong>Non-Negative </strong>checkbox. 
<ul><li>When you enter additional attribute of <strong>Number</strong> type, an option to select the number format in details is provided. 
<ul><li>When entering values in the <strong>Length</strong> and <strong>Precision</strong> fields of <strong>Format Line</strong> <strong>Designer </strong>the number will be rounded to this number of characters. 
</li><li>You can select <strong>Shift</strong>. 
</li><li>You can change <strong>Separator of fractional part</strong> (comma by default), define <strong>Group separator</strong> (space by default) and also to define <strong>Grouping. </strong>
</li><li>You can select <strong>Zero representation</strong>, for example, to remind of the need to enter a value to this field. 
</li><li>It is also possible to specify<strong> Representation of negative numbers. </strong>
</li><li>If needed, select the <strong>Display leading zeros </strong>check box. So if the number is less than the length specified, zeros in bits will be entered to match to the specified <strong>Length </strong>of the number. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Date</strong> - select the date<strong> </strong>content: <strong>Date, Time </strong>or <strong>Date and Time. </strong>
<ul><li>For the additional attribute you can specify the date format. To do this, go to the <strong>Format by default. </strong>You can select <strong>dd.mm.yyyy</strong> or <strong>yyyy-MM-dd </strong>format<strong> </strong>and <strong>Date Local Format </strong>(for example, <strong>May, 44, 4014) </strong>as well, to set <strong>Blank date representation</strong> (the warning is<strong> </strong>displayed in a blank field, for example, <strong>No date</strong>). </li></ul></li><li><strong>Composite type of data - </strong>this type of values provides an option to select type of data when you enter information to the catalog. Enable <strong>Composite type of data </strong>checkbox, then select checkboxes for the types of values to be selected. 
<ul><li>For example, the date of the company foundation is sometimes hard to specify exactly. IN this case it is possible to provide<strong> </strong>an option to select the data type (<strong>Date</strong> or <strong>String</strong>) while entering. If the exact date is known, then select <strong>Date</strong> type and enter the date if it is unknown, enter the date in a string form like 'Beginning of the 19th century'. 
</li><li>At that for all parts of the composite type of data it is possible to configure their standard settings, for example, configure format of the date and define line options. 
</li><li>When entering additional attribute (data) values of composite type of data first it is necessary to select the type of data.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Boolean</strong> - as a rule these values are <strong>True </strong>and <strong>False, Yes </strong>or <strong>No. </strong>
<ul><li>For additional attributes you can set another format for these values in <strong>Format Line</strong> <strong>Designer</strong>. You can write<strong> Representation of Boolean </strong><strong>False and True </strong><strong>values</strong>. IN this case the values entered at additional attribute setting shall be suggested instead of conventional Yes or No. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Additional value</strong> - this type of data is often used, at that information entry is based on the selection of values from the list. It is offered by the application by default. Both standard and grouped lists of values are applied. Using additional attributes (data) of <strong>Additional</strong> <strong>value</strong> type you can describe various properties of the application objects. 
</li><li><strong>Additional value (hierarchy)</strong> - such structure of lists is also widely used. It is called the hierarchy of the items. Items in such list have similar properties but may have slave items. At that the hierarchy can be rather complex. 
</li><li><strong>User</strong> - an option to use values of the <strong>Users</strong> list (and other lists) as additional attribute (data) is provided in the application.</li></ul><h3>Details for entering additional information of Additional value or Additional value (hierarchy) types</h3>
<ul><li>Except for standard fields the following fields are available: 
<ul><li><strong>Values are additionally characterized by weight factor</strong> - select the checkbox to use this option. <strong>Then</strong> field can be used for analysis in reports. The logic of this field use shall be decided by the user. The field is not mandatory. 
</li><li><strong>Value form header - </strong>enter header for<a href="Catalog.ObjectsPropertiesValues.Form.ItemForm/Help"> items entry</a> <a href="Catalog.ObjectsPropertiesValuesHierarchy.Form.ItemForm/Help">windows (items entry windows based on hierarchy</a>).

Application of individual headers for the windows to enter additional attributes and data and selection of values makes entry process more convenient and easy.</li></ul></li><li>After the data type is selected and <strong>Name</strong> field is filled in click <strong>Save</strong>. After this the list of values is available. To enter values click <strong>Create</strong>. Fill in all necessary fields. 
</li><li>If data were not saved before running the <strong>Create</strong> command<strong>, </strong>then the application displays the warning. To go to the values entry<strong> </strong>click <strong>Record.</strong></li></ul><h3>Update of additional attributes and data format</h3>
