<ul><li>address completeness; 
</li><li>absence of prohibited characters; 
</li><li>length of address attributes; 
</li><li>compliance with address classifier. In client/server mode Infobase, compliance of addresses with the address classifier is validated on the server side. When address validation is complete, the "Address is correct" message or list of errors will be displayed. Validation is not performed for addresses outside of the U.S. Validation is also not performed for free-format addresses.</li></ul><h3>Entering free-format addresses</h3>
<ul><li>In certain cases you may need to knowingly enter an invalid address (for example, an address on an incoming recepit is invalid and cannot be used, but you still have to enter it). For this, execute the <strong>All actions</strong> (or <strong>More</strong>, in Taxi interface) - <strong>Free-format address input</strong> command. The invalid address will be further used for storage, so this option should only be used as a last resort. 
</li><li>Once you execute the command, the "Free-format addresses are not validated by address classifier" message will be displayed. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to confirm, or click <strong>No</strong> to go back to the template-based address input form. 
</li><li>You will be offered a standard address input template where all fields, except <strong>Address presentation</strong> and <strong>Comment</strong>, are disabled. Enter the address into the <strong>Address presentation</strong> field. As soon as you start filling in the <strong>Comment</strong> field or click <strong>OK</strong>, the address you have entered will be automatically parsed and some of the disabled template fields will be filled in. The standard address validation procedure will not be performed. 
</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to confirm the address. It wil be saved as a free-format address, to be viewed without any changes.</li></ul><h3><a name="#1">Address input by postal code</a> </h3>
