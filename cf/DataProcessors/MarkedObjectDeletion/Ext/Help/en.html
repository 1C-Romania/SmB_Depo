<p>Designed to delete selected objects permanently.</p>
<p>While working with the application, you can mark objects for deletion (e.g. when they were entered by mistake). The <a href="Catalog.Users.Form.ItemForm/Help">user</a> having administrative rights can permanently delete objects marked for deletion.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Delete marked objects </strong>in the <strong>Administration - Support and service </strong>section.</p>
<p>Deletion does not affect link integrity, i.e. if a application object (a document, list item, etc.) is referred to by other objects, the object will not be deleted. Remember that deletion of marked objects is an irreversible operation. </p>
<p>Delete previously marked objects in one of the two ways described below:</p>
<ul><li><a href="#1">Delete all objects automatically</a> - try to automatically delete all the objects marked for deletions. 
</li><li><a href="#2">Delete objects selectively</a> - preliminarily select the objects before you delete them. </li></ul><h3><a name="#1">Automatic deletion of all marked objects</a></h3>
<ul><li>Click <strong>Delete</strong>. 
</li><li>In this mode, all marked objects will be found and deleted. After a while, a number of deleted objects is displayed. User intervention is only required if there are links to some objects and therefore they can not be deleted. </li></ul><h3><a name="#2">Selective deletion of objects</a></h3>
<ul><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>. 
</li><li>In this mode, a list of the objects marked for deletion is created. 
<ul><li>In the list, objects are grouped by type; by default, all objects are marked for deletion. 
</li><li>Clear the check boxes in the list to keep the objects that were marked for deletion. 
</li><li>Double-click the object or use the <img></img> <strong>Edit </strong>button to open the object and decide whether to delete it. </li></ul></li><li>For permanent deletion, click <strong>Delete</strong>. 
</li><li>After permanent deletion, you see the message showing how many objects were deleted. 
</li><li>If there are links to the objects, you see a warning and a list of the objects that can not be deleted and the objects preventing from deletion. </li></ul><h3>Actions when object can not be deleted</h3>
<p>The list of the objects that were not deleted consists of two parts: on the left - a list of the objects, on the right - the<strong> Usage places </strong>list. </p>
<ul><li>To delete objects permanently, firstly: 
<ul><li>Double-click in the list or click <strong>More - Edit </strong>to open the object preventing from deletion, e.g. to manually delete links to the target object from such an object. 
</li><li>Specify a link to another list item. Click <strong>Replace in all usage places </strong>to go to <a href="DataProcessor.ReplaceAndCombineElements.Form.ReplacementElements/Help">replacing items</a>. To replace links, select some other list item instead of the one to delete. 
</li><li><img width="16" height="16"></img> <strong>Mark for deletion </strong>all the objects linked with the item to delete (in the left part of the list - <strong>Usage places</strong>). 
</li><li><img width="16" height="16"></img> <strong>Unmark for deletion </strong>an object marked for deletion.</li></ul></li><li>Then click <strong>Redelete </strong>to try to delete the objects again. 
</li><li>Click <strong>Home </strong>to select another deletion method. 
</li><li>Click <strong>Close </strong>to return to the application without further deletion attempts.</li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
