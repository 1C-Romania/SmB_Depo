<p><a href="DataProcessor.DetailsBatchUpdate/Help">To change the attributes</a> after data entry, you can select special settings using the <strong>Additional options</strong> command<strong>:</strong> </p>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>Change in transaction </strong>(check box is selected by default) - the application allows processing the list of items selected to be changed in transaction. If it is not possible to record one of the objects (for example, because that object is being edited by other user) during recording with the check box selected, then changes in all objects will not be saved.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Interrupt in case of error</strong> - if objects are not updated in transaction, then it is recommended to select this check box (this check box is selected by default). IN case object recording is not possible due to some reasons, the application will display the warning and offer either to continue updating the remaining objects or to interrupt processing in order to find reasons of the problem. If the check box is not selected and the object can not be recorded, then the application ignores this object and continues updating the remaining objects.</div>
</li><li>
<div>
<p><strong>Process child items - </strong>this check box (selected by default) allows changing child items of the selected groups and parent objects without necessity to select check boxes for all items of groups and child objects. If the check box is cleared, the application processes the group instead of its child items.</p></div></li></ul><h3>Additional parameters for the administrator</h3>
<p>The following additional option is provided during administrator work using the <strong>Attribute group update</strong> conmmand of <strong>Administration</strong> section - <strong>Support and service</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<div>
<p><strong>Display service attributes and tabular sections </strong>- service attributes including service attributes of tabular sections are hidden by default. To display these attributes in the application object windows, it is necessary to select this check box. Service attribute editing can break the application operativity, therefore, it is recommended to use this option carefully and only for service purposes.</p></div>
