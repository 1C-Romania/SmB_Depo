<p><strong>3. How to set an offline workplace for the work of other users?</strong></p>
<p>At once after the first running the offline workplace is ready to work. Your account has administrative right in the application in the Internet as well.</p>
<p>If this offline worplace is going to be used by other users then it is necessary to set for them an access to the infobase in the <strong>"Users" </strong>list in the section <strong>"Administration"</strong>. IN this case they will be assigned the same access rights as in the application online. To get more information on maintaining the list of users and setting up an access see the application documentation .</p>
<p>Also if it is necessary for the users without your participation to synchronize the data with the online application then change the Internet connection settings, set by default. To do this use the command "<strong>Set up the connection</strong>... " in the <strong>"Offline work" </strong>window in section of "<strong>Administration</strong>". IN the form of settings specify the user on whose behalf it is necessary to synchronize data . For this user in the online application it is necessary to specify the profile "<strong>Synchronize the data with other applications</strong>."</p></body></html>
