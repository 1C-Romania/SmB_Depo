<p>It is intended for viewing the progress and <a href="DataProcessor.InfobaseUpdate/Help">delayed database update</a> results.</p>
<p>When updating the database the processing of some part of data can be delayed and processed in a background mode during application operation. IN this case, the documents that are not yet processed will be unavailable. At the attempt to open such a document, the application displays a message informing that the document processing is temporarily locked, as the application update was not completed. Some reports can also be unavailable. At the attempt to generate a report, the application displays a message informing that the report can contain incorrect data as the application update was not completed.</p>
<p>It opens automatically when application starts after the database is updated along with <a href="CommonForm.InfobaseUpdate/Help">Application revisions description</a> (<strong>What's new in configuration</strong>) window. </p>
<p>Information on delayed application update results can be found in<strong> </strong>the <strong>Administration - Support and maintenance</strong> section by running the <strong>Update results and Information processing</strong> command<strong>; </strong>or by the<strong> Additional procedures in progress </strong>link in the <strong>What's new in configuration</strong> window. After running the command the<strong> </strong>link changes its description to the <strong>Additional data processing procedures are being performed. </strong></p>

<ul><li>As a rule data processing can take a long time (from several minutes to several hours depending on the entered data volume and computer performance), and its execution can slow down user's work. So it is recommended to start data processing during user lowest activity period.
