<p>Security profiles - mechanism of 1C:Enterprise platform version 8.3 that provides managing the external (relative to 1C:Enterprise server clusters) infobases resources, such as file system directories, COM objects (for Windows-based systems), and external (relative to application) software modules based on 1C:Enterprise scripts, such as external reports and data processors,<strong> Run</strong> and<strong> Calculate </strong>methods calls, external components, operating system applications, and Internet-based resources. You can use security profiles to isolate any infobase and lock it from using any external resources not permitted by the administrator.</p>
<p>Previous versions of the platform required security profile with full access to external reports and data processors. IN the latest version, this limitation was removed and there is an option to specify stricter permissions for external code to use external resources (including code for external reports and data processors) than for infobases.</p>
<p>Now permissions to access external (relative to 1C:Enterprise server) resources are managed automatically. Administrator no longer has to maintain manually the list of external resources required for the application to operate. Instead, whenever the application requires access to an external resource, the user sees a dialog with the <a href="DataProcessor.PermissionSettingsForExternalResourcesUse.Form.PermissionSettingsForExternalResourcesUse/Help">list of required permissions</a>. If the requested permissions are approved by the administrator, they will be added to the security profile on servers' cluster. The security profiles generated for the applications are as strict as possible (for example, <strong>Full access </strong>to external reports and data processors check box is not selected by default).</p>
<p>When working with thin client under Linux, it is necessary to install RAS administration server in order to enable automated permissions control for security. When working under Windows, there are two options available: either using a RAS administration server or COM connection.</p>
<p>To enable automated permission management, adjust the <a href="DataProcessor.PermissionSettingsForExternalResourcesUse.Form.SecurityProfilesUseSettings/Help">settings</a> of the <strong>security profile usage mode</strong> in the <strong>Administration - Support and maintenance - Security </strong>section<strong>.</strong> </p>
<p>Security profiles are only available to owners of CORP client and server licenses for 1C:Enterprise 8 platform.</p></body></html>
