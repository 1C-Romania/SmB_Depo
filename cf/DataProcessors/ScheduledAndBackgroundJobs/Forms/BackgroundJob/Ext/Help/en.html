<p>Properties of a background job can be described as follows:</p>
<h3>Basic</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Name </strong>- a copy of the <strong>Name </strong>field for a <a href="DataProcessor.ScheduledAndBackgroundJobs.Form.ScheduledJob/Help">scheduled job</a>. Use the <strong>Execute now </strong>button on the scheduled job command bar to assign the "Manual start: &lt;Scheduled job presentation&gt;" value to the background job. 
</li><li><strong>State </strong>- possible values are "Job completed", "Job completed with errors", "Job cancelled by user", "Job in progress". 
</li><li><strong>Start date </strong>- date and time when the background job was started.
