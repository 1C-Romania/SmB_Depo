<p>The address classifier is used to store address data required to work with the application. </p>
<p>The address classifier ensures validity of structure and contents of address information in the application. The classifier contains a nation-wide list of street addresses. Using the classifier ensures quick and error-free address input, which is absolutely required to submit tax reporting documents correctly. For example, if you introduce any errors in the address format for an employee tax report, the report will be rejected. Besides, addresses tend to change without notification. The application offers address management functionality based on the address classifier.</p>
<p>The address classifier is available on the 1C:Enterprise user support website, on 1C:ITS discs, or as a separately downloaded file. </p>
<p>To access the address classifier management window, execute the <strong>Address classifier</strong> command located in the <strong>Administration - Setup and maintenance - Classifier</strong> or <strong>Catalogs</strong> section. </p>
<p>This window displays the application address data summary (number of regions for which the address data is available) and lists the basic address data management operations: downloading, clearing, checking for online updates.</p>
