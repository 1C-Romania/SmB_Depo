<p>The application enables you to enter the reminders and specify the time and subject, which activates the list of reminders at the time specified.</p>
<p>Various catalogs, documents and other application objects can be the subject of the reminders. For example, you may enter a <a href="InformationRegister.UserReminders.Form.Reminder/Help">reminder</a> linked to a certain partner, goods register etc., or a reminder about specifying or filling up any data.</p>
<p>You can open the reminder by<strong> </strong>running the <strong>Organizer - Remind</strong> command from various application objects. At that there is an option to enter only one reminder for an object.</p>
<p>You can also enter a reminder linked to any personal event or activity in the <a href="InformationRegister.UserReminders.Form.Reminder/Help">My reminders</a> list<strong> </strong>by running the <strong>Create</strong> command. Such a reminder can be useful, for example, to remember to wish a happy birthday to your colleague in time. The reminders combined with <a href="../idn0">notes</a> are well suited as an electronic replacement for the "stickers on the edges of the monitor".</p>
<h3>Reminder list</h3>
<p>At the time specified in the reminder, the application opens<strong> </strong>the <strong>Reminders</strong> list. The list contains all newly created and delayed reminders, that are about to be actuated. The text and overdue time are displayed for each reminder. If a reminder is linked to any subject date (for example, with a job deadline), then the reminder displays the time left till this event.</p>
<p>There is an option to go to a catalog item or another application object linked to the reminder directly from<strong> </strong>the list (by running the<strong> Open </strong>command or double-clicking). If the reminder is linked to the application object, the reminder will be opened.</p>
<p>You may click the <strong>Stop</strong> button to cancel the selected reminders, and delete them from the list. A periodic reminder remains active according to configured schedule after clicking the <strong>Stop</strong> button. You may cancel such a reminder in the <strong>My reminders</strong> list. You can postpone the reminders in the list for some time specified in the <strong>Remind after</strong> field by running the <strong>Postpone all </strong>command. You may fill the <strong>Remind after </strong>field with a value from the list, or type in a new value at any time.</p>
