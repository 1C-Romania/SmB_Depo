<p>It is intended to view the numbering of the scanned documents and their owners.</p>
<p>You can view the list by running the <strong>Scanning setup</strong> - <strong>Open numbers of the scanned files</strong> command on the <strong>Working with files</strong> tab in personal application settings.</p>
<p>The application automatically assigns the number to the scanned files. You can monitor the files movement in the list and view the deleted files. </p>
<p>The list includes:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Owner</strong> - object of the application. If the number was used in several objects of the application, you can view it in the list; 
</li><li><strong>Number</strong> - number of the scanned file.</li></ul><h3>Nulling the numbers of the scanned files</h3>
<ul><li>When scanning it can be necessary to reset the numbering of the scanned files (start from zero) for some owner of the files (files folders or list item), for example if some images were scanned for test purpose, and after testing you need to scan final images with correct numbers. 
</li><li>To do this, you need to find the owner of files and set the value to 0.</li></ul><h3>See also</h3>
