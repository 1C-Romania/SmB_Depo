<h3>About prohibition to change (load) data</h3>
<p>Sometimes when working with the infobase required to prohibit changes of some data till the specified date. For example, after the date of quarterly financial Statusments to the tax office, usually establishes a prohibition to change of those data, which where used to generate the Statusments, that is, data till the due date of the reporting period.<br>Prohibition to load unlike the prohibition to change can be set for the data, which need to be edited in one infobase node only, and also by rules, which follow from the requirements of data exchange, instead of the typical companie's business processes.<br>Prohibitions of data loading can not be used. IN this case, the form of configuration data change prohibition dates is only available.</p>
<h3>The manifestation of the Created prohibition</h3>
<p>If the date of prohibition to change the data IsSet, then when the user attempts to make changes to the IB before the date of prohibition to change; user will receive message about impossibility of change of data. If the date of prohibition to change is not set, then the restrictions is not acting. If in the closed period  IS objects, marked on deletion, then their deletion will not be possible.<br>If the date of prohibition to Import data IsSet, then when a user attempts to export the data to the IB before the date of prohibition to load all prohibited to downImport data will be skipped, the information will be recorded to the event log, and the allowed data to be loaded.</p>
<h3>Possibilities of setting prohibition dates</h3>
<p>When setting the prohibition date not only an custom date can be specified, but also relative. For a relative dates (except the value <strong>Previous day</strong>) on the form, you can specify the number of "postponement" days up to the date of prohibition, during which prohibition still will not act.<br>Relative dates of prohibition should be recalculated daily. Schedule job provided for this purpose. However, for the file IB and in other cases you may need to recalculate the current values of relative prohibition dates manually. Recalculation can be performed by command <strong>Recalculate dates</strong>.</p>
<p>If the date of prohibition must be set for all users of the system (for all nodes of exchange plan), then in the field <strong>Setting the prohibition date</strong> it is necessary to choose value <strong>For all users</strong> (<strong>For all exchange plan nodes</strong>). Thus in the form following fields became available: <strong>Prohibition date specifying mode</strong> and field <strong>Prohibition date</strong>. </p>
<p>If to a different users (exchange plan nodes) it is necessary to set different values of date of prohibition, then in the field <strong>Prohibition date setting</strong> it is necessary to choose value <strong>By users</strong> (<strong>By exchange plan nodes</strong>). Thus in the form appeared a list, where you can add users/group of users  (exchange plan nodes) and adjust for each of them its date of a prohibition. The list contains the default item <strong>&lt;For all users&gt;</strong> (<strong>&lt;For all exchange plan nodes&gt;</strong>). This item can't be modified or removed. Adjustments of date of prohibition applied for this item will be used for all users (exchange plan nodes) except for those, which are contained in the list. To configure the date of prohibition, you need to select in the list required user/group of users (exchange plan node) or item   <strong>&lt;For all users&gt;</strong> (<strong>&lt;For all exchange plan nodes&gt;</strong>), and perform the adjustments in the fields below <strong>Company contract date specifying method of</strong> <strong>prohibition</strong> and <strong>Prohibition date</strong>.</p>
<p>Way of specifying the date of prohibition can have a following values:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Common date</strong> – with this method one date of prohibition IsSet for all of the data items of IB. 
</li><li><strong>By sections</strong> – for each section of the application set its own date of prohibition. The sections in the context of which it is possible to set the date of prohibition, for example, are the next:  <strong>Planning</strong>, <strong>Inventory accounting</strong>, <strong>Trade</strong>. When the date of prohibition specified by sections, in the form available list, in which you can add <strong>Sections </strong>(with appropriate command) and indicate for each section its value of date of prohibition. IN a list by default is the item <strong>&lt;Common date&gt;</strong>. The value of date of prohibition for that item will be used for all sections by default except of those, which are already in the list. If in the field <strong>Prohibition date setting</strong>  specified <strong>For all users </strong>(<strong>For all exchange plan nodes</strong>), then remove the item <strong>&lt;Common date&gt; </strong>and sections are impossible. If in the field <strong>Prohibition date setting</strong>  specified <strong>By users</strong> (<strong>By exchange plan nodes</strong>), then it is possible to remove <strong>&lt;Common date&gt; </strong>and sections. 
</li><li><strong>By objects</strong> – dates of prohibition are specified in the context of application objects. For each object its own date of prohibition IsSet. Objects in the context of which it is possible to set the date of prohibition, for example the following:  <strong>Demo: Storage locations</strong>, <strong>Demo: Access groups of partners</strong>. If this value is chosen, then a list to which you can add an objects (by appropriate command) is available on the form and specify wor each object its own date of prohibition. Just as in the previous method in the list for the same purpose is an element <strong>&lt;Common date&gt;</strong>. 
</li><li>By sections and objects – with this method dates of prohibition are specified by the sections and by the objects. Sections, in context of which you can set date of prohibition, for example, are the following: <strong>Planning, </strong><strong>Inventory accounting, </strong><strong>Trade</strong>. Objects, in a context of which date of prohibition can be set, for example: <strong>Demo: Storage locations</strong>, <strong>Demo: Belongs to groups of partners</strong>. IN case when the date of prohibition IsSet by sections and objects, the list is available in the form, in which you can add sections and objects, specified for each section and for each object own value of date of prohibition. Just as in the previous methods, list contain element <strong>&lt;Common date&gt;</strong> for a similar purpose.</li></ul><p>You can group data of the reports by sections/objects: <strong>Report on the sections and objects for users </strong>(<strong>Report on the sections and objects for exchange plan nodes</strong>) or by users (by exchange plan nodes): <strong>Report by users </strong>(<strong>Report on exchange plan nodes</strong>). Report allows you to see the resulting dates of prohibition, set for users/group of users (exchange plan nodes) with the priorities.<br></p></body></html>
