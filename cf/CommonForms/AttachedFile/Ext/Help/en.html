<ul><li>
<div>
<div>In thin client, <a href="CommonForm.EditSpreadsheetDocument/Help">editing table documents files</a> (.mxl<strong> </strong>format) is done in the imbedded form of a table documents editor.

</li><li>
<div>
<div>The<strong> More - Edit</strong> command opens the file in editing mode and also locks the file in the application. The locked file becomes unavailable for editing by other user of the application and is displayed in green in the list</div></div>
</li><li>
<div>The<strong> More</strong> <strong>- Finish editing</strong> command unlocks the file, saves it in the application and removes the edit locking mark. When you finish editing, save the file and close the external application</div>

<ul><li>With the help of the<strong> More - Update from file on hard drive</strong> command you can update the file from the original file on the drive (based on which the file was initially created in the application)</li></ul><h3>Digital signature and encryption</h3>
<p>When you use a digital signature, the <strong>More - Digital signature and encryption</strong> drop-down<strong> </strong>menu<strong> </strong>becomes available, which contains the following commands for working with digital signatures:</p>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>Sign - </strong>creates a digital signature for the file. Before creating a digital signature, the <a>application suggests choosing a </a>digital signature certificate from those available on the computer. You can choose the certificate also during application settings customization. A file being signed becomes unavailable for editing and is displayed in lists with the  <img src="CommonPicture.DigitallySigned"></img>icon</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Add digital signature from file - </strong><a href="CommonForm.AddDigitalSignatureFromFile/Help">adds signature</a> to the file. You can use this command, for example if the signature (signature file) was obtained later than the signed file was</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Save with digital signature</strong> - <a href="CommonForm.SaveWithDigitalSignature/Help">saves signature</a> to the file on the hard drive. The command can be used, for example if you need to pass a signed file to another person</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Encrypt - </strong>starts file encryption<a>. </a>Unlike signing, several certificates may be used, for example if you need to encrypt a file for several users. Encrypted files are displayed in lists with the <img src="CommonPicture.Encrypted"></img>icon</div>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Decrypt - </strong>initiates file decryption<a>. For</a> decryption you need to enter the password for the private key</p></li></ul><p>When using digital signatures and encryption, the following tabs are available :</p>
<h3>Digital signatures</h3>
<p>The tab includes information about the file digital signature:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Signature author - </strong>the user who signed the file 
</li><li><strong>Signature date - </strong>the date of signing the file 
</li><li><strong>Comment</strong> - additional signature information to be entered  
</li><li><strong>Status</strong> - the signature validity status</li></ul><p>With the help of the related commands you can:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Sign</strong> a file 
</li><li><strong>Open the signature</strong> - to open the window with basic properties of the digital signature certificate for the selected file: to whom it was issued and by who, purpose and validity period of the certificate on the basis of which the signature was created 
</li><li><strong>Check</strong> if someone changed the signed file using one or several digital signature certificates. For this purpose, select one or several signatures. If the digital signature of the stored file does not correspond to any digital signature certificate, such digital signature after the checking is displayed in red in the list and has the <strong>Not valid</strong> satus in the status column <strong></strong>
</li><li><strong>Check</strong> <strong>all</strong> - to check all signatures 
</li><li><strong>Save</strong> the digital signature to<strong> </strong>the file on the hard drive 
</li><li><strong>Remove </strong>the digital signature from the file</li></ul><h3>Allowed to decrypt</h3>
<ul><li>
<div>The tab includes information on file encryption</div>
</li><li>
