<p>Easy mode of access rights setup.</p>
<p>You can set up the access rights using profiles. The profile defines some series of actions with application data that the user is authorized to. As a rule, the profiles comply with a variety of job responsibilities (or kinds of activity) of the application users. You can assign users to several profiles at a time. These profiles all together form personal access rights settings.</p>
<p>In order to set up <a href="Catalog.Users.Form.ItemForm/Help">access rights</a> (<a href="Catalog.ExternalUsers.Form.ItemForm/Help">external user rights</a>) run the <strong>Access rights</strong> command in navigation bar.</p>
<h3>User profiles</h3>
<p>Select the profiles check boxes that a user needs for work in the application in the <strong>User profiles</strong> list. </p>
<p>As a rule, profile combines several roles. All roles set in this profile are assigned to a user when assigning a profile to him. For example, the <strong>Administrator </strong>profile includes <strong>Total rights</strong> role that provides unlimited access to all data. User rights can be set up only by application administrators (users for whom the <strong>Administrator</strong> profile check box is selected). </p>
<p>There are default and additional profiles:</p>
<ul><li>Default profile describes some group of access rights sufficient for certain scope of work in the application. 
<p>For example if an employee performs only accountant functions in the application, select the <strong>Accountant</strong> profile and <strong>User</strong> service profile (it allows to log on to the application) for this user.</p>
</li><li>In addition to main rights you can assign a user auxiliary rights using user additional profiles. For example, in addition to main <strong>Accountant </strong>and <strong>Warehouse keeper </strong>profiles, you can use the <strong>Company counterparties correspondence</strong> and <strong>Unposted documents printing</strong> profiles<strong>.</strong></li></ul><h3>Access types</h3>
<p>The list is displayed on the right side of the profile list, if<strong> </strong>the <strong>Limit access to </strong><strong>records</strong> check box in<strong> </strong>the <strong>Administration - Users and rights settings </strong>section is selected. There is an option to<strong> </strong>set the limits of data area allowed to a user for operation using the <strong>Kind of access</strong> field. </p>
<p><strong>Kind of</strong> <strong>access</strong> is a rule that "allows" accessing the application data. For example, there is an option to allow a user to work only with documents of specific companies, or to hide documents of some companies using the <strong>Companies</strong> kind of access.</p>
<p>The content of the access kinds given in the list depends on the profile selected in the list on the left. Besides, the profile also defines the kind of access setup: it gives the right to preview or edit the documents. For example if the profile includes the <strong>Goods receipt </strong>documents reading role, the user is allowed to view the documents of specified companies. IN case the profile contains adding or changing role, the user can edit such documents.</p>
<p>Specify the <strong>Access value </strong>for<strong> </strong>each<strong> </strong>kind of access. Select the <strong>All prohibited, All allowed</strong> values from the list or specify exceptions. Each kind of access can be configured in two ways:</p>
<ul><li>Specify the list of allowed values - such method is used when you need to provide the access to a certain data area only. 
</li><li>Specify the list of values that shall be unavailable. Such setup method is convenient when you need to limit the access to a known data area, and the access shall be provided to all entered into the application values by default. For example if the <strong>Companies</strong> kind of access<strong> </strong>sets a rule prohibiting to work with "Future prospects" company documents then these restrictions will not be valid for a new company called "Innovate technologies" entered into the application later. At that, you need to keep in mind that permission settings have a priority over prohibition settings. If a user from the above example will be allowed to input the company documents of "Future prospects" in some other group with the same profile, then eventually he will get an access to all the documents of this company. 
<ul><li>Click<strong> Add</strong> to specify exceptions, and then select the values you need from the list.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In some cases you can specify the item groups rather than a single item in order to simplify access rights setup in the list of permitted or prohibited values. For example, the access can be limited for the <strong>Partners</strong> kind of access in terms of the partner access groups rather than for each and every partner. To do this, you need to define the partner access list and specify a certain group for each member of the group. Not only the administrator can do this, but any user with relevant rights for partner list editing.</p>
<p>You can set up the permissions for some profiles using the <strong>Users </strong>kind of access (<strong>External users</strong> kind of access for external users). It applies only to documents and other application objects with the fields defining users access to these documents ("Authorized", "Author", "Performer", etc.). To provide the access to all data handled by some user, you need to put them in the list of allowed values for the <strong>Users</strong> kind of access. For example, the access to products and services receipt documents depends on the person specified in the <strong>Responsible</strong> field, so the user is allowed to write documents with the field defining himself as a user of this document, or one of the users from the allowed for the <strong>Users</strong> kind of access list. You can set up restrictions in a similar way.</p>
