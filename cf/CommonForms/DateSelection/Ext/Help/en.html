<p>It is intended to select a date to shift the holiday of the <a href="Catalog.BusinessCalendars.Form.ItemForm/Help">production calendar</a>.</p>
<p>The national business calendar with working days, holidays and holiday shifts approved by the government is included into the application delivery package.</p>
<p>However, sometimes it is required to fill in temporary data manually (as a rule, at the beginning of the year). It makes sense if calendar data is necessary, but the calendar is not yet officially approved and it is not yet available in the application since not all holiday shifts were approved by the government. There is an option to fill in the shifts in advance, and further when national calendar is approved and included into the application delivery package, the holiday shifts will be corrected automatically.</p>
<p>You can open it by running the <strong>Shift the day</strong> command in a production calendar.</p>
<p>Select the shift date, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
