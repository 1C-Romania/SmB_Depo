<p class="Usual">For enterprises comprising of multiple legal entities (<a href="Catalog.Companies/Help"><font color="#000080">organizations</font></a>), you can maintain management accounting either for all the organizations (for the entire company) or for each organization individually.</p>
<p class="Usual">Management accounting relies on the data recorded in the electronic documents. An operation fact is entered once and then reflected in different management accounting sections; management balance is also formed.</p>
<p class="Usual">You can register and generate most primary documentation concerning the company's economic activities: sales, procurement, warehousing, and production. Electronic versions of paper documents provide clear registration of business.</p>
