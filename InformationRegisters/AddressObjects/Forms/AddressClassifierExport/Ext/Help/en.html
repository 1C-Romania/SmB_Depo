<p>The application stores the address data, required for operation in the address classifier. </p>
<p>In order to provide structure and content unity for address data the Federal Information Address System (FIAS) is used. FIAS contains postal addresses of the Russian Federation. FIAS helps to fill the addresses correctly and quickly. You can not submit a report without it. For example, employees tax or pension reporting requires that the addresses are filled according to the standard, otherwise the report will not be accepted. Moreover, the addresses can be changed, and the user is not always able to track such changes himself. The application allows managing addresses and maintain them updated using FIAS.</p>
<p>The user can export the address data on any regions of the Russian Federation from the user support website of<strong> 1C:Enterprise </strong>application of 1C company and also from files, distributed by the Russian Federal Tax Agency. </p>
<p>To open the window for working with address classifier, run the <strong>Address classifier - Import classifier </strong>command in the <strong>Administration - Support and service</strong> section. </p>
