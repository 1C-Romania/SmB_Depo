<p>You can use the data processor to print the form of personal data processing consent.</p>
<p>The Federal law No. 153-FL from 06/27/2006 "About personal data" ordains to get the consent for processing of personal data being processed in a application. </p>
<p>To open the processor, run the <strong>More - Consent for personal data</strong> <strong>processing</strong> command from the application lists or from the list items. You can print the form from any application lists that include personal data. </p>
<h3>Personal data operator</h3>
<ul><li>Enter<strong> Consent date</strong>. 
</li><li>In<strong> </strong>the <strong>Company</strong> field select the <strong>Company name,</strong> i.e. personal data operator, from the <a href="Catalog.Companies/Help">list</a>. 
</li><li>The <strong>Address </strong>field is filled automatically if it is filled in the <strong>Companies</strong> list<strong>. </strong>If it is not filled, you can fill it manually or (if eligible) there is an option to enter the address into the <strong>Company</strong> <a href="Catalog.Companies.Form.ItemForm/Help">card</a> and select it from the list again for the <strong>Address</strong> field to be filled automatically<strong>. </strong>
</li><li>In<strong> </strong>the <strong>Responsible person for PD processing</strong> field write <strong>Initials of employee</strong> who enters personal data.</li></ul><p>At that, it may happen that data has already been entered into the application (before the effective date of the law, before the acceptance of corporate regulations, etc.), or it may happen that personal data has not been entered yet. IN other words, when corporate regulations are approved, we hire the employee, and generate the personal data consent form prior to entering his data into the application. IN order to do this the application provides two printing modes of the consent form.</p>
<h3>Printing the form for new employees</h3>
<ul><li>When you hire a new employee his personal data are not entered into the application yet. The HR manager generates the printing consent form, which includes company data and no personal data, there are blank spaces instead. Employee fills in his data, signs the document, and then HR manager enters data into the application, the consent is stayes in the company in paper form. 
</li><li>If personal data is still unavailable at the time of the consent generation (the employee is being hired) you can type the data into the printing form or there is an option to print out the form with columns to be filled. IN order to<strong> </strong>do so switch the <strong>Subject personal data</strong> toggle into the <strong>Not available yet in the infobase </strong>position<strong>.</strong></li></ul><h3>Print the form using application data</h3>
<ul><li>In case personal data is already entered into the application, the HR manager selects in the list personal data of those individuals, who must provide a consent, and prints the consent forms. At that, you can enter all data related either to companies or personal data of individuals into the form. 
</li><li>To print the<strong> Consent for personal data processing</strong> form for each individual run the <strong>More - Consent of personal data processing</strong> command in<strong> </strong>the relevant row of the list or list item. 
</li><li>To print the consent form for individuals whose data is entered into the application<strong>, </strong>change the <strong>Subject personal data </strong>radio button to the <strong>will be imported from infobase</strong>. This will insert the data on the selected individuals stored in the application into the tabular section. 
</li><li>To print a form for several list items (for example, employees of one company) select several records using the left mouse button, and<strong> Ctrl </strong>or<strong> Shift</strong> keys. 
</li><li>If you select several list records, these data is imported into the document tabular section. You can specify any missing personal data in the table (<strong>Address</strong> and<strong> Passport data</strong>). 
</li><li>If necessary, add missing records into the list using the <strong>Add </strong>button, type the data manually<strong>. </strong>
</li><li>If the list in the tabular section contains several individuals, the number of generated print forms will be equal to the number of lines in the tabular section (each list item will have its own form). </li></ul><h3>Print the consent form</h3>
<ul><li>To <a href="CommonForm.PrintingDocuments/Help">print the form as a spreadsheet document</a> in <strong>.mxl</strong> format click the <strong>Print</strong> button, specify the number of copies you need, and then click the <strong>Print</strong> button.
