<p>There are two methods of a database update that can be applied in addition to each other:</p>
<ul><li>
<div>using exclusive data processors:</div>
<ul><li>
<div><a href="Catalog.Users/Help">users</a> operation is locked.</div>
</li><li>
<div>it is applied for updating those data that shall be processed by the moment of users logon to the application.</div>
<ul><li>
<div>the less such data, the less downtime is.</div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>
<div>using delayed data processors:</div>
<ul><li>
<div>users are allowed to log on to the application.</div>
</li><li>
<div>it is applied for updating the "archived" part of the database which is rarely used by users or which allows users to start their work not waiting the end of data processing.</div></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Database update</h3>
<ul><li>After application upgrade (in the <strong>Designer </strong>mode or using basic versions of the<strong> Configuration update</strong> <a href="DataProcessor.ConfigurationUpdate/Help">assistant</a>) it is required initially to run the application with Administrator rights. The application will complete final update procedures at the start, this process may take a long time (depends on the update and computer performance). 
</li><li>Before the application initial start, it is recommended to close all user sessions. It is necessary for correct update of the application version. 
</li><li>In case users are still working in application it is possible to <a href="DataProcessor.UserWorkBlocking/Help">close active sessions</a> preventing the update in a file mode, and to lock application logon temporarily (in client-server version the start is interrupted with a message informing about active sessions). By clicking the link you can view the <a href="DataProcessor.ActiveUsers/Help">active users list</a> and request them to stop their work, or to continue update of the database by clicking the <strong>Log out and repeat </strong>button. 
</li><li>After that, the active sessions of other users working in the application are prepared to log out. Application displays a message informing the users to complete their work in all active user sessions. Application operation is aborted within the time specified in the message and the update continues. 
</li><li>Still the application is running and an empty desktop with a <strong>Application version Update </strong><a href="DataProcessor.InfobaseUpdate.Form.InfobaseUpdateProcessIndication/Help">message</a> is launched. Message displays the number of new database version after update. Progress bar indicates the database update progress - graphically and in percent. To get detailed information about<strong> the database update process </strong>follow the <strong>Technical update info</strong> link from <a href="DataProcessor.EventLogMonitor/Help">the events log</a>. 
</li><li>In case the outdated platform version is launched, the application displays the message requesting platform version update and locks the desktop. 
</li><li>When a database is updated the application restarts automatically. The desktop in launched at once, but application operation is locked, and in order to continue operation it will be necessary to confirm the <a href="DataProcessor.SoftwareUpdateLegality/Help">update authorization</a>. The user is allowed to start working in the application after confirmation. 
</li><li>In case of update exception, the application displays an <a href="DataProcessor.InfobaseUpdate.Form.UnsuccessfulUpdateMessage/Help">error message</a> and it is necessary to contact the technical support. It is possible to view messages occurred during the update process by clicking the <strong>For more information see the events log</strong> link. IN this case, you can not continue work in the application. 
</li><li>In case of the successful update of the application, the <strong>What's new</strong> window appears. All application users will be unlocked, and they can log on to the application.</li></ul><h3>Descripton of application changes</h3>
<ul><li>After successful update of the application you can view the <a href="CommonForm.SystemChangesDescription/Help">description of changes</a> and improvements made in a new version (<strong>What's new in configuration</strong> window), go to the events log to read technical events occurred during the update process, and also, run and then monitor the <a href="DataProcessor.InfobaseUpdate.Form.InfobaseDelayedUpdateProgressIndication/Help">delayed data processing progress</a> (in case it is provided in this version of the application). Later, you can opent the <strong>What's new </strong>window from the <strong>Main</strong> section.</li></ul><h3>Aspects and advantages of delayed database update</h3>
<ul><li>In client-server mode the application update can provide for additional data processing, which runs in the background mode in order to reduce downtime. At that, users can start their work in a application, not waiting for the completion of such processing. During the processing some of the application functions can be temporarily unavailable as the update is not yet completed. 
</li><li>In this case, the documents that are not yet processed will be unavailable. At the attempt to open such a document, the application displays a message informing that document processing is temporarily prohibited, as the application update was not completed. Some reports can also be unavailable. At the attempt to generate a report, the application displays a message informing that the report can contain incorrect data as the application update is not completed.</li></ul><h3>Delayed update process control</h3>
<ul><li>In those cases, when application update provides for the background delayed data processing the administrator can review delayed application update procedures progress by running the <strong>Update results and data processing</strong> command in<strong> </strong>the <strong>Administration </strong>- <strong>Support and maintenance</strong> section, or by clicking the <strong>Additional procedures in progress</strong> link in the <strong>What's new in configuration</strong> window. </li></ul></body></html>
