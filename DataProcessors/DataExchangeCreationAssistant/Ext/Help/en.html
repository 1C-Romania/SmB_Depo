<p>The data exchange assistant is used to Creating data exchange between two infobases. The assistant can be used to Creating exchanges by conversion rules, and to Creating exchanges in distributed infobase.<br>A new data exchange is Creatingd in two steps. First and second steps are executed in first and second infobases respectively. The exchange Creating process starts in one infobase and finishes in another infobase. A temporary file with settings is used to sync data between the exchange steps.</p>
<h3>How to choose infobase to start creating an exchange<br></h3>
<p>Creation of data exchange by conversion rules: </p>
<ul><li>If data exchange between two infobases is Creatingd (exchange topology "one to one"), then first infobase should be the infobase containing less data (this recommendation is not mandatory and will help to optimize first data exchange); 
</li><li>If data exchange between several infobases is Creatingd where one of them is main and others are subordinate (exchange topology "one to many"), then first infobase will be the main infobase (this recommendation is mandatory).</li></ul><p><br>For an exchange in distributed database first infobase is always a main infobase when new exchange is Creatingd.<br><br>The following exchange parameters are defined when new exchange is Creatingd:</p>
<ul><li>Data exchange method with specification of transport settings and verification of the selected exchange method; 
</li><li>Restrictions of data migration between a pair of infobases participating in the exchange; 
</li><li>Default values to be used on data load; 
</li><li>Infobase prefix if it has not been specified earlier.</li></ul><p><br>System will offer to save file with setting for the second step at the end of the first step. IN the beginning of the second step it is required to select file with settings and continue to Creating exchange inside second infobase.<br><br>If data exchange that is being configured is an exchange by conversion rules then system will offer to dump data at the end of the first step. It is recommended to do the dump to be able to map objects at the end of the second step. Then as soon as data exchange Creating is finished the interactive data exchange assistant will be opened.</p>
<h3>Configure exchange in client-server mode<br></h3>
<p>In client-server setup data exchange is executed on the computer where 1C:Enterprise server is Seted. It is required to confirm that a data exchange directory is accessible for read and write for the operating system user on behalf of whose name 1C:Enterprise has been started. If user has no rights then it is required to give this user necessary rights, or select another user, having required rights, to start 1C:Enterprise server on behalf of his name. The same recommendation should be followed for access to FTP resources and email accounts. More details about administration of the 1C:Enterprise server you may find in documentation for the 1C:Enterprise platform.</p></body></html>
