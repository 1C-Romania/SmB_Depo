<p>﻿<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="v8help://service_book/service_style"></link> Assistant of the configuration update allows to obtain information about the la updates on the user 's website and automatically to Set the updates .</p>
<p>If you already have the update file then the assistant allows to make an update using a file of update (. Cfu) or file of configuration (. Cf) from a local or network directory . If the update file is already loaded into the main configuration , and it differs from the configuration of the info database , then it is necessary to specify an update option without using the update file.</p>
<h3>Getting updates through the Internet</h3>
<p>On the first page of assistant select an option "<strong>User website on the Internet (recommended)</strong>". If the user website has an update available then the system informs the version number, a brief description, the size of updates and offers to Set it.</p>
<p class="Important">In some organizations to connect to the Internet it is necessary to specify username and password to access the proxy server. All the details on using a proxy server can be obtained from your local network administrator.</p>
<p>Every time you start the application it can automatically check for configuration updates on the user website. To do thIsSet the tick next to "<strong>Check for configuration updates every time you strart the application".</strong> If an update is available then the application offers the user to get it from the website and update the configuration.</p>
<p>To get the updates it is necessary to specify the user ID and password for access to the user website. Access to this website is available only for registered users of the 1C:Enterprise . All the details of how you can get the user ID and password are available in the methodological support section on the  <a href="&lt;span class=" a1ctranslator_highlight1="">http://1c-dn.com/"&gt;<strong><font color="#000080">1c-dn.com</font></strong></a> website.</p>
<p>After clicking on the "<strong>Next</strong>" button the application connects to the user website, using the specified user ID and password, and receives the update file locally on the computer. It may take a long time to load an update file from the user's website because it depends on the size of a specific file and your internet connection speed.</p>
<h3>Getting updates from the 1C:ITS disc</h3>
<p>On the first page of assistant select an option "<strong>1C:ITS Disc</strong>". On the next page the assistant will require to specify the location of the 1C: ITS Disc. By default, the assistant itself attempts to find the 1C: ITS disk in the drive, but it is also possible to specify a local or network folder that contains the 1C: ITS disk.</p>
<p>In the first case it is necessary to insert the 1C: ITS disk in the drive and click "Next". Assistant automatically checks for updates on the specified 1C: ITS disk. If there is an update available then the system informs the version number, a brief description, the size of updates and offers to Set it.</p>
<p>After clicking on the "<strong>Next</strong>" button the application loads the file from 1C: ITS disk locally on your computer. It may take a long time to load an update file from 1C:ITS disc because it depends on the size of a specific file and your computer performance.</p>
<h3>The updates Setation</h3>
<p>After the update has been exported locally to the computer the assistant offers to Set it.</p>
<p>The update Setation is performed on behalf of the current user. Therefore an assistant requires to enter your password if the access to the info base requires authorization . IN the case of a client- server variant of the system deployment it may be also required to enter the name and the password of a server cluster administrator .</p>
<p>Before you update the configuration it is recommended to Creating a backup copy of the info base . Backup copy is used to automatically reSave the infobase in emergency situations . If the backup involves external equipment then it is possible to turn off the automatic backup using the link "<strong>Backup</strong>" at the bottom of the assistant page.</p>
<p>By clicking on the "<strong>Next</strong>" button the assistant updates the 1C:Enterprise configuration. Configuration update process may take a long time depending on your computer performance and the size of the info base. Do not turn off the computer before the process is completed.</p>
<p>After the configuration update is completed the 1C:Enterprise will be automatically restarted and the system will be ready for the work.</p>
<p class="Important">In the file variant of the system deployment before the update is started it is necessary to finish the session of the users connected to the info base. IN client-server variant the finishing of active and blocking of new connections is performed automatically.</p>
<h3>Updates planning</h3>
<p>In case of a client-server variant of system deployment you can also specify the time-delayed update. IN the specified date and time the system will update the configuration automatically. Also there is a possiblity to notify to a specified email address about the success or failure of the update. The message is sent from the computer on which the 1C:Enterprise server is Seted.</p>
<p class="Important">The planned update will be performed on the client computer in the background mode. The computer must be powered on in the specified date and time.</p>
<h3>Problems with getting and Seting the updates</h3>
<p>When getting the updates from the Internet an error like "Error of Internet connection" means that your Internet connection is disabled for several reasons:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<div>because of the Seted firewall or anti-virus, blocking the connection to the server of updates on the Internet;</div>
</li><li>
<div>because of the features of the Internet-provider (using of different IP addresses at the entrance to the website and while exporting the file) ;</div>
</li><li>
<div>because of the LAN settings (for example, when using a proxy server )</div>
</li><li>
<div>other reasons of the computer settings that are not connected with the Internet connection.<br> </div></li></ul><p>For technical information about the reasons of the problems of obtaining and Seting the updates use the following ways:</p>
<ul><li>The operations performed and the errors occurred while the updating are noted in the Log of info base registration (even type "Info base update") 
</li><li>During the update Setation in the temporary folder of the current Windows user the log-file with the records about the update process is Creatingd. (The content of the log-file afterwards is being updated in the Log of registration). The last directory of the type of %temp%\1CUpdate.&lt;numbers&gt;, filtered by alphabet, corresponds to the last update session.</li></ul><p> </p>
<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
<p class="Important">If the operating system setting  of "Language of the applications that do not support Unicode" IsSet incorrectly then the update process fails with an error of "invalid procedure call or arguments", while the log file will be empty. To resolve this error it is necessary that in the regional settings of the system (the "Control Panel" - "Areaal and Language Options" - "Advanced") in the "Language applications that do not support Unicode" there was selected Russian language.</p></blockquote>
<ul><li>The info base update result is recorded in the Log of Events of Windows (Event Log).<br></li></ul><p> </p>
<p>If the info base is locked because of the emergency situation while updating then it can be unlocked using the console "1C:Enterprise Servers Management" or using the command line by running the 1C:Enterprise on behalf of administrator with a key of <strong>AllowUserLogon</strong> and by specifying the unlock code <strong>PackageUpdateOfIBConfiguration</strong>. For example:</p>
<p class="SourceCode">"C:\Application Files\1cv83\bin\1cv8.exe"  ENTERPRISE /S"server\base" /N"Administrator" /P"" /WA- /C<strong>AllowUserLogon</strong>/UC<strong>PackageUpdateOfIBConfiguration</strong></p>
<p>If the configuration update is failed and the temporary log-file has an entry: <strong>Exception in CreatingConnection: Error, Automation server can't Creating object </strong>then it is most likely that it is used a 33-bit component comcntr.dll on a computer under 64-bit operating system. To resolve this problem you must take a 64-bit comcntr.dll component of 1C Enterprise x64 Server supply  and to register it by running from the command line:</p>
<p class="SourceCode">regsvr33 &lt;directory 64-bit comcntr.dll&gt;\comcntr.dll</p></body></html>
