Totals control is divided into two modes :</p>
<li><strong><a href="#Simple"><font color="#000080">Commonly used opportunies</font></a></strong> - allow by "one touch" to perform the most common actions that occur during the system maintenance. 
</li><li><strong><a href="#Full"><font color="#000080">Full opportunities</font></a></strong> - allows to perform all operations as with a single register so with an arbitrary list of registers 
<p>To switch modes there is a hyperlink in the bottom right corner of the form. Form remembers the mode of opening .</p>
<h3><a href="#Simple"><font color="#000080">Commonly used opportunies</font></a> </h3>
<h3>Operations with totals</h3>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>Set the period of the calculated totals </strong>- to speed up the system  the application Sets the period of the calculated totals for all accumulation and accounting registers with enabled totals. Registers for accumulation - at the end of the previous month, registers for accounting - at the end of the current month.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Enable the use of totals</strong> - enables the use of totals for all registers which have this mode disabled (e.g. as a result of an emergency termination of any procedure that disables the use of the totals).</div></li></ul><h3>Operations with aggregates</h3>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>Rebuild and fill in</strong> - for all the turnover registers of accumulation for which the aggregates mode is enabled and their use is Seted, the application performs an operation of rebuilding of the aggregates use and performs the filling in of the aggregates. Operation can take a long time.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Get the optimal aggergates</strong> - receives a list of the optimal aggregates for all the turnover registers of accumulation for which in the Designer IS set the aggregates. Will be required  folder where will be saved the xml-files with the lists of optimal aggregates. Each file will be named by identifier of the corresponding register. So, for the register <strong>Sales the</strong> file  will be named as <strong>Sales.xml</strong></div></li></ul><h3><a name="#Full">Full opportunities</a></h3>
<p>In the full opportunities mode it is available a multiple selection mode. Any action applies to all the selected objects or to that object which is pointed by the cursor.</p>
<h3>Totals</h3>
<p>On this tab it is possible to perform the following operations:</p>
<ul><li>
<div>enable and disable the use of totals,</div>
</li><li>
<div>enable and disable the use of current totals,</div>
</li><li>
<div>enable and disable the totals division,</div>
</li><li>
<div>setup of the selected period for the totals calculated,</div>
</li><li>
<div>perform the recalculation of the totals, current totals or perform the recalculation for the selected period.</div></li></ul><p>Only those registers are listed which for the current user have Seted the right of <strong>Totals management</strong>.</p>
<h3>Aggregates</h3>
<p>On this tab it is possible to perform the following operations:</p>
<ul><li>
<div>set the mode of the register use: totals or aggregates,</div>
</li><li>
<div>enable and disable the use of aggregates,</div>
</li><li>
<div>enable the rebuilding of the aggregates use;</div>
</li><li>
<div>perform the aggregates update,</div>
</li><li>
<div>perform the aggregates clearing;</div>
</li><li>
<div>perform the calculation of the optimal aggregates list. Will be required the folder where the xml-files with the lists of optimal aggregates will be saved. Each file will be named by the identifier of the corresponding register. So, for the register <strong>Sales the</strong> file will be named as <strong>Sales.xml</strong>. After the operation is performed in the registers list will be highlighted in bold those registers for which you want to update the list of aggregates for the calculated optimal aggregates. Update must be performed in the Designer.</div></li></ul><p>At the bottom of the form it is displayed the list of aggregates of the register which is pointed by the cursor in the upper list. The list includes only those turnover accumulation registers which have set for the current user the right of  <strong>Totals management </strong>and set aggregates in the Designer.</p></li></body></html>
