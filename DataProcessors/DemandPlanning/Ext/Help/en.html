<ul><ul><li class="Usual">The data processor form contains tree of items and information about them. IN the columns of the data processor the following data is indicated: Item, characteristic, total deficit Amount, overdue demand SUM(in Item units) on current date, and demand forecast by dates.<br>By selecting item in the tree, you will see the calculation details: 
<ul><li>anticipated inventory balance; 
</li><li>anticipated receipts and expenses; 
</li><li>minimum and maximum stock level; 
</li><li>order details – sources of supplier invoices and expenses.</li></ul></li></ul></ul><p></p>
<ul><li><strong>Important.</strong> IN column <strong>"Overdue"</strong> values: 
<ul><li>anticipated receipts, having receipt date earlier than current date; 
</li><li>anticipated expenses, having expense date earlier than current date; 
</li><li>maximum stock level if current inventory balance is equal or less than minimum stock level (current balance is subtracted from maximum stock level).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Important.</strong> It is assumed that overdue indicators will be reached when the indicators in planned period are calculated. 
</li><li><strong>Deficit </strong>calculation: if value of minimum stock balance is equal or greater than closing stock balance, then closing stock balance is subtracted from maximum stock balance. 
</li><li>Calculation of indicators in planned period: 
<ul><li><strong>Opening</strong> is equal to deficit Amount plus closing balance from previous column. 
</li><li><strong>Receipt</strong> is equal to sum of all anticipated supplier invoices. 
</li><li><strong>Demand</strong> is equal to sum of all anticipated inventory expenses. 
</li><li><strong>MIN Balance</strong> is equal to minimum stock balance defined for specific item. 
</li><li><strong>MAX Balance</strong> is equal to maximum stock balance defined for specific item. If maximum balance is zero – consider that it is equal to minimum stock balance. 
</li><li><strong>Amount (Cur.)</strong> = Opening balance + Receipt – Demand</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote>
