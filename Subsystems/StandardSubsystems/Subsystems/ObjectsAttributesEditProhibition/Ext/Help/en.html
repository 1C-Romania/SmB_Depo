<p>Configuration prohibits to edit (after initial filling ) some attributes of objects that define the character of the object and that can be nominally called as the key attributes of this object. Typically, the key attributes are the object details that influence the behavior of the other objects, for example, posting the documents. Hastful change of such attributes can lead to a mismatch of an accounting data.</p>

<p>An example is the attribute <strong>Currencies </strong>of the catalog <strong>Account, petty cashes </strong>that defines the currency of the balances of this Petty Banking or a sign <strong>Is a service</strong> of the <strong>Items</strong> directory which influences the documents posting with the same items. Such attributes can not be changed after the balances of this petty cash or after the documents with these items are shown.</p></body></html>
