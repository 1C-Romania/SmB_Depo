<h1>Inventory turnover report</h1>
<p>Use this report to analyze the turnover and average storage period of the products in a warehouse. </p>
<p>The following values are calculated for each inventory item: average balance for period, consumption for period, turnover ratio, and average storage period in days. </p>
<ul><li>
<div>The turnover ratio is a ratio of the quantitative inventory consumption for the period to the average inventory balance for the period.  </div>
</li><li>
<div>The average balance is calculated as a sum of the balances for each reference point divided by the number of the reference points. </div>
</li><li>
<div>The number of the reference points is calculated from the period stated in the report and from the periodicity selected in the report. For example, when the report data is analyzed for a week, the periodicity stated in the report is one day. Therefore, there will be seven reference points. </div>
</li><li>
<div>The reference point of the period start is added to the calculated number of the reference points. </div>
</li><li>
<div>The average storage period in days is calculated as a ratio of the number of days in the report interval to the turnover ratio.<br></div></li></ul><p>Select the report periodicity to influence the ratio calculation accuracy. It is <strong>not recommended </strong>to generate a report without specified period start and end.</p>
