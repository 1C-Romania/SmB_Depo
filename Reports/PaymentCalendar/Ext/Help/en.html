<h1>Payment calendar report</h1>
<p>The report allows to analyse and plan the cash assets transfer. It is generated based on the data of the cash expenses requests, scheduled receipts and transfers of the cash assets, as well as the cash assets transfers scheduled in accounts and orders. When generating the report the feasibility is checked automatically - cash assets sufficiency in the places of their storage.</p>
<p class="Usual" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">Report columns are grouped into three levels: the first level contains the totals for the currency, the second - totals by type of cash assets (cash and non-cash), the third - totals on petty cashes and accounts. Using this structure you can see the changes of the detailed balances of petty cashes and accounts, as well as totals by types of cash assets and currencies.</p>
<p class="Usual" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 36.0pt"> </p>
<p class="Usual" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">The report lines include three blocks - available balance, overdue and scheduled payments. Available balance is the cash balance as of the current date. Overdue and scheduled payments contain data on payments, totals by days and totals with respect to current balance. Text of the unapproved payments is highlighted in red. The background of lines containing payments leading to the cash gaps (negative balance of the petty cash or account) is highlighted with a dull pink color.It allows to identify such payments at any level of groupings (for example, there are no negative balances of cash assets in total, but there are negative balances for some petty cashes).</p>
<p class="Important">IMPORTANT. The period for which the scheduled payments are selected is defined from the starting date of the period of Overdue payments to the end date of the future payments period. The start of the Overdue payments period defines the date from which the scheduled Overdue payments and the dates of their payments are selected.</p></body></html>
