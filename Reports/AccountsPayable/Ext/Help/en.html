<h1>Accounts payable report</h1>
<p>The report displays the state and dynamics of accounts payable for the selected period of time. The report may be generated in two modes – <strong>Statement </strong>and <strong>Balances.</strong></p>
<p>In the<strong> Statement</strong> mode the report contains data on the company's accounts <a href="Catalog.Counterparties/Help">payable</a>, including <a href="Document.PurchaseOrder/Help">orders</a> and <a href="Catalog.CounterpartyContracts/Help">contracts</a>, under which the deals between company and <a href="Catalog.Counterparties/Help">counterparties</a> were concluded. <br>The report is generated for the period specified. The report data is grouped by <a href="Catalog.Counterparties/Help">counterparties</a>, <a href="Catalog.CounterpartyContracts/Help">contracts</a>, and <a href="Document.PurchaseOrder/Help">orders</a>. IN the <strong>Balances</strong> mode the report contains data on the balances of company's accounts payable, including orders and contracts under which the deals between company and counterparties were concluded. <br>In the <strong>Balances</strong> mode the groupings are the same as in the<strong> Statement</strong> mode.</p>
<p>Each mode of the report may be generated in currency or in the currency of accounting.</p>
