<p>Access group properties.</p>
<p>An access group defines actions with the application data available for the group members. Usually, <a href="Catalog.AccessGroups.Form.ListForm/Help">access groups</a> correspond with different job duties (or occupations) of the application users.  A user may be a member of one or more access groups. Together such groups represent their personal access settings.</p>
<p>Use an access group to define and administer the common settings of the access rights of a certain group of users with similar functions, e.g. <strong>Accountants</strong>.</p>
<p>To manage access, you need administrator rights. The user responsible for the access group can <a href="#1">add or delete members of their access group</a> on the <strong>Members </strong>tab.</p>
<p>An access group is always connected with one of the existing <a href="Catalog.AccessGroupsProfiles/Help">access group profile</a> that usually combine multiple roles. When added to a group, the user gets all the roles specified in the profile of this group, e.g. the predefined <strong>Administrators </strong>access group is associated with the <strong>Administrator </strong>profile having the <strong>Full rights </strong>role. This role grants unrestrained access to all the data and belongs to all the application administrators listed in the <strong>Administrators</strong> access group. </p>
<h3>Adding access group</h3>
<p>For a new access group, start with creating its profile (recommended to make it first), users list and access restrictions.</p>
<ul><li>Select <strong>Profile</strong>. It determines the rights (with a roles list) and options of "domain" rights restrictions (access types), e.g. restrictions to <strong>Organizations</strong>, <strong>Warehouses, </strong>etc. The access types from the profile will be added to the access group automatically.  
</li><li>Proceeding from the objectives and restrictions for the existing access types, enter the <strong>Name </strong>of the access group (<a href="Catalog.AccessGroups/Help">For more information, see access group purposes</a>). 
<ul><li>It is recommended to name an access group as a relevant profile in plural (in the <strong>Profile </strong>field). The name should also identify the access settings of the access group, e.g. on the basis of the <strong>Sales managers </strong>profile, you can introduce such access groups as <strong>Sales managers at X Company</strong> and <strong>Sales managers at Y Company</strong>.</li></ul></li><li>A group can belong to one of the access group <a href="Catalog.AccessGroups.Form.FormGroup/Help">folders</a>. 
<ul><li>In the <strong>Group (folder)</strong> field, select a folder from the <a href="Catalog.AccessGroups.Form.GroupChoiceForm/Help">list</a>.  </li></ul></li><li>Click <img></img>to select the <strong>Member type -</strong> according to the access group purpose, you can appoint members as <strong>Arbitrary members</strong> (you can include <a href="Catalog.Users/Help">users</a> and <a href="Catalog.ExternalUsers/Help">external users</a>) or predefined users. 
<ul><li>To restrict your choice to a specific list, select the values: <strong>Regular users</strong>, <strong>External users </strong>("Demo:Counterparties"), <strong>External users </strong>("Demo: Individuals"), <strong>External users </strong>("Demo: Partners"). 
</li><li>An access group may include the above users and <a href="Catalog.ExternalUsersGroups/Help">external user groups</a> (it may be necessary, e.g. for questioning). 
</li><li>If you select <strong>Arbitrary members</strong>, you can select different user types (regular and external users) for your group.</li></ul></li><li>On the <a href="#1">Members</a> tab, complete a list of access group members. 
</li><li>On the <a href="#2">Access restrictions</a> tab, configure the additional settings of the access rights. 
</li><li>On the <strong>Description</strong> tab, you can enter detailed information about the access group. </li></ul><h3><a name="#1">Members</a></h3>
<ul><li>
<div>According to the selected <strong>Member type</strong>, this access member selection tab will provide the following user lists. </div>
<ul><li>
<div>To add multiple members, click <strong>Select</strong>, to add one member, click <strong>More - Add</strong>. Select necessary access group members from the list.  </div>
</li><li>
<div>To delete one or more access group members, select them and click <strong>Delete</strong>.</div></li></ul></li><li>
<div>Fill in the <strong>Responsible user </strong>field (select them from the <strong>Users </strong>list). The user marked <strong>Responsible </strong>in an access group can add or delete its members. </div></li></ul><h3><a name="#2">Access</a> restrictions</h3>
<ul><li>On the <strong>Access restrictions </strong>tab, specify additional access settings. The access group restrictions depend on the profile restriction but get more particular. Sometimes profile access restrictions settings do not require details. In such cases, the <strong>Access restrictions </strong>tab<strong> </strong>is unavailable.  
</li><li>The access types stated on this tab depend on the profile selected in the <strong>Profile</strong> field. The profile also determines how the access type setting will function: either it is read-only mode or editing is allowed, e.g. if the access groups profile includes a role for reading documents, <strong>Goods receipt</strong>, the users can view the documents of stated organizations. If the profile contains a role for adding and editing, you can edit such documents. 
</li><li>Use the <strong>Access kind</strong> field to define the database scope allowed for the access group members. Access kind is a certain rule determining the access to the application data, e.g. the <strong>Organization </strong>access kind will allow operations only with the documents related to specific organizations or hide the documents of some organizations.  
</li><li>To configure restrictions, define a list of values for each access kind. 
</li><li>
<div>Double-click to state your values (or perform the <strong>Edit</strong> command of the left-click context menu). Define the <strong>Access value </strong>for each <strong>Access kind</strong>. You can use one of the following values:  </div>
<ul><li><strong>All prohibited</strong>. You can state a list of allowed values for an access kind. This configuration method is good when you need to grant access only to a specific data domain. 
</li><li>
<div><strong>All allowed</strong>. You can state a list of the values that will not be accessible for a certain access kind. This method is suitable when you need to close access to some predefined data domain, while all other existing and new values will be accessible, e.g. the <strong>Organizations</strong> access kind states a rule prohibiting operations with the documents of X Company. If a new organization, Y Company, is added to the application later, this rule will not cover it. Note that allowing settings prevail the forbidding ones. IN the above example if the user is allowed to add documents for X Company in some other group with the same profile, this user will be allowed to access all the documents of the organization. </div></li></ul></li><li>
<div>When necessary, each <strong>Access kind</strong> can have a values list or a values groups list that will state all the exceptions. Click <strong>Add </strong>in the <strong>Allowed (Forbidden) values </strong>list. Select exceptions from the proposed lists.</div>
<ul><li>Sometimes, you can simplify the procedure by stating entire item groups in the allowed/forbidden values list instead of separate items, e.g. the <strong>Partners </strong>access kind can be restricted with the entire partner domain, instead of separate partners. To do it, specify the list of groups accessible for the partners and associate each partner with a certain group. Besides the administrator, any other user is permitted to edit the partner list.</li></ul></li><li>In some access groups, you can set rights with the <strong>Users </strong>access kind (similarly, the <strong>External users </strong>for external users). This setting is valid only in the documents (and other application objects) which fields can relate to the users getting access to these documents ("Responsible", "Author", "Performer", etc.) 
<ul><li>To permit all the access group members to access all the restricted data being processed by a certain user - add this user to the allowed values for the <strong>Users </strong>access kind. 
</li><li>For example, access to the <strong>Goods and services receipt</strong> documents depends on who is specified in the <strong>Responsible</strong> field. IN this case, the user can record the documents which <strong>Responsible </strong>user is that very user or is added to the <strong>Users </strong>access kind. The forbidding setting functions similarly. </li></ul></li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
