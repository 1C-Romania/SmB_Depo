<p>User's <strong>full name</strong> is displayed in all the lists and reports. The check box <strong>Not valid</strong> is cleared by default for all users. But if the user for some reason no longer works with the application and at the same time it can not be removed because of the links to it from other objects in the application then it is recommended to set a tick next to <strong>Not valid</strong>. This user can not be selected, for example, as a task executive or responsible for the document and it is not displayed in the list of users .</p>
