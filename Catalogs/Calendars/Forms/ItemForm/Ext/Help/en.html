<p>Work schedule data.</p>
<p>Work schedule is entered basing on the <a href="Catalog.BusinessCalendars.Form.ItemForm/Help">production calendar</a>. <a href="Catalog.Calendars/Help">The work schedules</a> can be entered either for the whole company or its divisions (for example, work schedule of a warehouse).</p>

<h4>Entering a new work schedule</h4>
<ul><li>Enter<strong> Name</strong>, for example, "Information technologies division work schedule". 
</li><li>Specify<strong> Schedule period</strong>, for example, <strong>from</strong> 01/01/2014 <strong>to</strong> 07/31/2014. 
<ul><li>To do this, you can 
<ul><li>type in necessary dates manually 
</li><li>select from calendar by clicking <img src="StdPicture.Calendar"></img>. </li></ul></li><li>the period starts on January 1 of the current year by default. 
</li><li>if the period ends on December 31, this field can be left empty - the application fills the schedule till the end of the year by default.</li></ul></li><li>Select the <strong>Business calendar </strong>from the<strong> </strong><a href="Catalog.BusinessCalendars/Help"><font color="#000080">list</font></a>, on the basis of which the schedule will be set. There may be several calendars, as holidays and days off are different in different regions. If a company uses single production calendar, then it is selected by the application by default. 
</li><li>Select<strong> </strong>the <strong>Filling method: </strong>
</li><li><strong>By weeks</strong> - weekly or hourly work schedule is linked to week days. It is the simplest and frequently used work schedule. This type of calendars includes "40-hour working week" schedules and other. Weekly schedules include five-day week, six-day week, two-day week and so on. They differ only by the number of working time or working days. 
</li><li><strong>By cycles - </strong>this schedule is linked to the dates of month, as a certain date is used to specify the cycle start from which the days of the cycle are counted. Week days do not influence this schedule, holidays are included very seldom. The example of cyclic schedules are the shifts schedules, as well as schedules with flexible weekend: one working day after three days off, two after two and so on. 
<ul><li>As an example let us consider work schedule for a warehouse that receives and ships out products 24 hours within 4 days. Structural unit, warehouse closes for equipment maintenance and disinfection for one day. IN this case the cycle length is 5 days. 
<ul><li>Specify the length of the cycle, for example, <strong>By 5-day cycles</strong>. The field is mandatory. 
</li><li>Specify the cycle start, for example, <strong>starting from</strong> 01/03/2014. The field is mandatory and filled by the application automatically. The cycle starts from the beginning of the <strong>Schedule period</strong> (for example, from 01/01/2014), it is possible to specify other date if necessary. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><li>Create <strong>Filling template</strong>. You can do this in two ways as follows: 
<ul><li>Specify working days using check boxes. This action is enough to display working and weekend days in the work schedule. After that it is possible to move to next steps of filling the work schedule, view the result of filling and save the schedule. 
</li><li>Enter the work schedule for each working day with the help of the <strong>Fill schedule</strong> link. Usually company and its divisions work according to a specific schedule. 
<ul><li>Fill <strong>Work schedule</strong> for each working day of the week or cycle by clicking the <strong>Add</strong> button. Enter <strong>Start time</strong> and <strong>End time</strong> of a working day. 
<ul><li>Working time is specified for work schedule only. If there are breaks in work, then it is necessary to fill the schedule in several lines, as breaks are not included in working time. Weekends are not filled. 
</li><li>When schedule is filled, click <strong>OK</strong>. Total Amount of hours and work mode will be specified in the link, check boxes are selected for working days by default. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Select the <strong>Include holidays</strong> check box if necessary. IN this case the holidays specified in the chosen production calendar will be excluded from working days. 
<ul><li>If holidays are included in work schedule and pre-holiday working time will be different, <strong>Fill pre-holiday schedule</strong> by clicking the <strong>Fill schedule</strong> link similarily to work schedule. </li></ul></li><li>Specify the<strong> Planning horizon</strong> - enter the number of months, for which the schedule should be filled in advance. If planning horizon is filled, then application compares schedule fill period with planning horizon months number, and generates warning if the schedule is not filled up to the date needed. 
</li><li>Application indicates to what number the schedule is filled in the information field under the <strong>Planning horizon</strong>. 
</li><li>Type in <strong>Description</strong> - fill in the detailed information on the entered schedule. It will help to find the work schedule you need in the list, when there is a lot of schedules.
